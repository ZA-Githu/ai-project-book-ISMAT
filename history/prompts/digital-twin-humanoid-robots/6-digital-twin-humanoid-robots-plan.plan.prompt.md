## Prompt

---
description: Execute the implementation planning workflow using the plan template to generate design artifacts.
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/setup-plan.ps1 -Json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design

4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType qwen`
   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use
   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
   - Add only new technology from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications

---

As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.

1) Determine Stage
   - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate Title and Determine Routing:
   - Generate Title: 3–7 words (slug for filename)
   - Route is automatically determined by stage:
     - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
     - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc)
     - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‑native)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.
   - If the script fails:
     - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/…`)
     - Allocate an ID; compute the output path based on stage from step 2; write the file
     - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT

4) Validate + report
   - No unresolved placeholders; path under `history/prompts/` and matches stage; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.
   - On failure: warn, don't block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`.


## Response snapshot

I have successfully completed the implementation planning for the Digital Twin Humanoid Robots module. Here's what was accomplished:

1. Created the implementation plan (plan.md) with technical context, constitution check, and project structure

2. Performed research (research.md) covering:
   - Gazebo integration and physics simulation
   - Unity integration for high-fidelity rendering
   - Sensor simulation concepts
   - Digital twin architecture concepts
   - Educational content strategy
   - Free-tier infrastructure strategy

3. Defined the data model (data-model.md) including:
   - Course module structure
   - Chapter entities for Physics, Visual, and Sensor simulation
   - Simulation component entities
   - Digital twin entity relationships
   - State transitions for learning progression

4. Created a quickstart guide (quickstart.md) with:
   - Setup instructions for the Docusaurus project
   - Directory structure for Module 2
   - Sidebar configuration
   - Content templates for chapters
   - Development workflow

5. Created the contracts directory (though not applicable for documentation site)

6. Updated the agent context with new technology stack (Gazebo, Unity, sensor simulation)

7. Verified that all constitutional requirements are satisfied

The plan aligns with the feature specification and follows constitutional principles, focusing on educational content about simulation for digital twins using open-source tools where possible to maintain free-tier compatibility.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete implementation plan for digital twin humanoid robot simulation module
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (documentation task)
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/ in specs/001-digital-twin-humanoid-robots/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.tasks to generate implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The planning phase successfully outlined a comprehensive approach to implementing the educational module with simulation tools, fully aligned with constitutional principles.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
