# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) Context

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module introduces ROS 2 as the foundational nervous system for humanoid robots, enabling communication, control, and coordination between perception, decision-making, and actuation.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain ROS 2's role in humanoid robotics
- Understand the concepts of nodes, topics, and services
- Connect Python AI agents using rclpy
- Interpret humanoid structure using URDF

This module is structured into three chapters that build upon each other, starting with the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 as middleware, followed by communication primitives, and concluding with how AI agents interface with robot systems.
