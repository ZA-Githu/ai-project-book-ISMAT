# Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Robotic Brain

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on developing the robotic brain using NVIDIA Isaac technologies for perception, simulation-driven training, and autonomous navigation in humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation using Isaac Sim
- Explain hardware-accelerated perception with Isaac ROS
- Understand VSLAM and navigation pipelines
- Explain path planning for bipedal humanoid movement using Nav2

This module consists of three chapters that build upon each other, starting with simulation and synthetic data generation, followed by perception and SLAM, and concluding with navigation for humanoid robots.

## Chapter Overview

1. [Chapter 1: NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Synthetic Data](./chapter-1-nvidia-isaac-sim.md) - Focuses on photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation for perception training
2. [Chapter 2: Isaac ROS: Accelerated Perception & VSLAM](./chapter-2-isaac-ros-perception.md) - Covers hardware-accelerated perception and visual SLAM fundamentals
3. [Chapter 3: Nav2 for Humanoid Navigation](./chapter-3-nav2-humanoid-navigation.md) - Explores path planning concepts and constraints of bipedal movement

Each chapter builds on the previous one but can be studied independently depending on specific interests in the Isaac technology stack.
