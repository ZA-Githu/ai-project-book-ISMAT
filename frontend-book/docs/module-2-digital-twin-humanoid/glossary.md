# Glossary: Simulation Concepts for Digital Twins

## Simulation Terms

**Digital Twin**: A virtual representation of a physical system that mirrors its real-world counterpart's properties and behaviors.

**Physics Engine**: Computational system that simulates the behavior of physical objects in a virtual environment, including forces, motion, and collisions.

**Collision Detection**: Algorithms to identify when two or more objects make contact in the simulation environment.

**Dynamics Modeling**: The simulation of forces and torques acting on rigid bodies, including inertial properties and joint dynamics.

**Ray Casting**: A technique for determining distance measurements by projecting rays and calculating intersections with surfaces.

## Robotics-Specific Terms

**LiDAR** (Light Detection and Ranging): A sensing method that measures distance using pulsed laser light to create high-resolution maps of the environment.

**IMU** (Inertial Measurement Unit): A device that measures and reports linear acceleration and angular velocity using accelerometers and gyroscopes.

**SLAM** (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping): The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.

**Gazebo**: A physics-based simulation environment that provides realistic sensor simulation, robot models, and environmental interactions.

**ROS/ROS2**: Robot Operating System (version 2), a flexible framework for writing robot software that provides services for hardware abstraction, device drivers, and message passing.

**URDF** (Unified Robot Description Format): An XML format used to describe a robot's physical and kinematic properties in ROS.

**Point Cloud**: A set of data points in 3D space that represent the external surface of an object or environment, typically generated by 3D scanners or depth cameras.

## Noise and Accuracy Terms

**White Noise**: A random signal with equal intensity at different frequencies that sounds like static.

**Bias**: A systematic deviation from the true value that remains constant or changes predictably over time.

**Quantization Noise**: The difference between an analog signal and its digital representation, caused by rounding or truncation during digitization.

**Temporal Coherence**: The consistency of measurements over time, ensuring that repeated measurements of the same phenomenon yield similar results.

**Kalman Filter**: An algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time to produce estimates of unknown variables, often used in sensor fusion applications.
