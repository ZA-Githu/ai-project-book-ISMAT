# Module 2: Digital Twin Humanoid Robots

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on creating digital twins of humanoid robots using simulation and rendering engines to mirror real-world physics, sensors, and interaction.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand physics-based simulation for robotics
- Simulate gravity, collisions, and dynamics in Gazebo
- Use Unity for high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction
- Simulate core robotic sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)

This module is structured into three chapters that build upon each other, starting with the foundational physics simulation, followed by visual rendering, and concluding with sensor simulation.
